# Connect4

In this game, we assign each player a few discs. The goal of this game is to drop the discs into empty spaces. Next the players have to connect any four discs vertically, horizontally or diagonally. The first player to do this wins. This is a two-player game. If all the empty spaces are filled without anyone connecting any discs then the game is considered to be over.
